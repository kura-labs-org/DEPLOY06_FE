# Overview

When it came to having Jenkins serve our website so that we could test it, we needed to know the IP address of the node serving the website. We initially had the build step set to `any agent`. This meant that the IP could be either one of the 3 nodes we had set up. Our test stage was set so that the third node would do the testing. We knew the IP of each of our nodes, but because `any agent` was used, we didn't know until Jenkins started running, which agent would be used. A neat way to do this would be to have those IP addresses saved in some global resource table or something of that like so that Jenkins could simply refer to that table and look through the IPs. Instead, what was done, was setting the build step to be done by the second agent, and hard coding the second agent's IP address.
